# WoW Art Tools

This add-on was created for [Belvane’s](https://twitch.tv/belvane) community but is free to use for any and all 3D Artists who use Blender and create World of Warcraft art.

---

**QUICK DISCLAIMER:** This is for use specifically with World of Warcraft models / assets /
etc. I do not recommend using these tools for models from other games because I
haven’t tested that use case and I will not be able to help troubleshoot any problems
that arise from you doing so!

_That said, you're welcome to try if you really want to. Just don't expect optimal results and again, I won't be able to help._
